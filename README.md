# Bootcamp-Bitirme-Projesi

This project was given to us in order to get a certificate from the patika.dev iOS bootcamp. It acts as a travel companion app
where with the right data was meant to show suggested hotels or flights, give random sightseeing locations and/or attractions.

We were supposed to use Alamofire for networking however since we weren’t given any API's to use,
and online/ready ones weren’t free or working, I had to use Mock API in order to finish the project.

Coredata was supposed to be implemented for "Bookmarking" any flight or hotel details. Wasn't implemented
